:notebook_with_decorative_cover: In this tutorial you should expect to learn the following:

* To control how long computer vision algorithms will run in terms of degree of accuracy or/and number of iterations. Here you will learn about the `cv::TermCriteria ` class.
* How to specify a continuous sequence of integers using the `cv::Range` class.
* How to use OpenCV's smart pointer `cv::Ptr` - the equivalent of `std::shared_ptr` in C++.
* How to handle errors/exceptions raised whilst running your programs.
* Understand the importance of the classes `cv::InputArray` and `cv::OutputArray` in helping to write generic functions that accept all kinds of data inputs e.g. `cv::Mat`, `cv::Matx`, `std::vector`, `std::array`, `cv::Point`, `cv::SparseMat` etc. You will need this understanding if you want to create your own algorithms in future.
