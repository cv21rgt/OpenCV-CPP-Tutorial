**Topic:** **Image Borders**

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: This is a short tutorial in which we will look at the following:
 
 1. How to create borders around an image. OpenCV provides a number of options, from providing user-defined values to replicating pixel values. This will help us in future tutorials when we start to deal with algorithms that make use of neighbourhood pixels. It will become easier to understand how such algorithms deal with border pixels, which do not have enough neighbourhood pixels. 
 2. We also pay special attention to how we can force an algorithm to focus on a particular region of interest while avoiding the influence of pixels from the parent image.
