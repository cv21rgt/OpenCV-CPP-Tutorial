:notebook_with_decorative_cover: In this tutorial we will look at some basic image processing operations. These operations on their own or in combination are required in advanced image processing topics - hence the need to master these operations at this stage. These operations include: 

1. Accessing pixel intensity values
2. Image arithmetic - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
3. Image blending
4. Bitwise operations
5. Masking
6. Color spaces
